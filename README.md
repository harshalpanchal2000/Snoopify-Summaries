# Snoopify Summaries ðŸŒŸ

Snoopify Summaries is a web application that allows users to generate summaries of YouTube videos quickly and efficiently. Whether you're looking to review educational lectures, catch up on podcasts, or stay updated on product launches, Snoopify Summaries has you covered! An Abstractive text summarizer trained using lstm based sequence to sequence model with attention mechanisim. The attention model is used for generating each word of the summary conditioned on the input sentence.

- Used CNN_DailyMail dataset.
